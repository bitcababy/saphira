Saphira
=======

Saphira is a file manager written for RoR using dragonfly. It's created for the great Railsyard CMS, but it's using the mountable engines introduced in rails 3.1, so it would be useable without RY as well.

Currently this project is under development and not finished at all but in order to have it under version control, it's already available on github.

--------
* Create folders
* Upload files

Requirements
------------
* [Rails 3.1.x](http://rubyonrails.org/)

* [awesome\_nested\_set](https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set): An awesome replacement for acts\_as\_nested\_set and better\_nested\_set.
* [exifr](https://github.com/remvee/exifr/): EXIF Reader
* [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id): It allows you to create pretty URLâ€™s and work with human-friendly strings as if they were numeric ids for ActiveRecord models.

* _And some more gems in development mode_

Installation
------------
Add the gem to your gemfile: `gem 'saphira', '~> 0.1.0.beta2'` and add `mount Saphira::Engine => "/saphira", :as => 'saphira'` to your `routes.rb` file to mount the engine. The file manager should be available at `http://localhost:3000/saphira` then.
